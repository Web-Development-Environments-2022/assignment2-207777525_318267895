- About Page - A modal dialog that can be opened above each div, includes an animation for the title and contains details on patterns we used and difficulties we faced during the assignment.
- Game Page - Sets the food and pacman location randomly. The ghosts move towards the pacman, and when they meet the pacman loses life and the game continues. The game ends when Pacman's life is over, or time's over. The Pacman will win if he has gained over 100 points in time constraints and has not run out of life, otherwise he will lose.
                During the game elements like clock, candy, medicine and star pop up, each giving points, life or time.
